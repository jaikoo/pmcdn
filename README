Poor Mans CDN
=============

This is a demonstration app that is supposed to be used with the article found on my blog
http://jaikoo.com/articles/show/181 

It's designed with the following goals:
i) Demonstrate clearly how to stream a file form S3 with Merb
ii) No database access. This helps when you're running in a cloud computing environment.
iii) Show how frikkin cool Merb routing is.

Before you put this in production please be aware that you'll probably want some sort of security
in the assets controller.

Any questions send them to jonathan at jaikoo dot com

Cheers
